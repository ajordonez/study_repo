    "### **Project Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines a predictive model designed to determine motorcycle accident risk across NYC, based on intersection characteristics, finding patterns within individual characteristics, accident concentration by zip code, and commonalities among high risk areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal**: \n",
    "\n",
    "The model aims to aid insurance companies in adjusting premiums for high risk profiles and areas as well as provide government agencies with actionable data to improve traffic safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on doing so by analyzing historical accident data from the last 4 years, traffic patterns, and intersection structures. The predictive model will identify high risk areas and attempt to predict future accidents within a certain margin of error. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Insights**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance policies could adjust premiums for high risk zip codes, while government agencies may enhance road safety measures, such as speed cameras and street widening, in these areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**: \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on using a combination of a few programming languages to achieve our goal, we will be indicating when we use a specific one. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using SQL, and more specifically Google's RDBMS BigQuery and MySQL to retrieve and clean data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using R to help with complex statistical analysis on the cleaned dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python to be tying all the parts of the project together as well as for some extra analysis and regression."
